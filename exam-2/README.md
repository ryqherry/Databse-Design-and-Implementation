# Exam #2

In this exam, you will Use [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.io/), or any other Jupyter Notebook editor you prefer, to open the Jupyter Notebook named [analysis.ipynb](./analysis.ipynb). Instructions of what to do are included within that notebook.

## Submit your work

Use Visual Studio Code to perform git `stage`, `commit` and `push` actions to submit. These actions are all available as menu items in Visual Studio Code's Source Control panel.

1. Type a short note about what you have done to the files in the `Message` area, and then type `Command-Enter` (Mac) or `Control-Enter` (Windows) to perform git `stage` and `commit` actions.
1. Click the `...` icon next to the words, "Source Control" and select "Push" to perform the git `push` action. This will upload your work to your repository on GitHub.com.
