## What Makes the Original Data Set Not Compliant with 4NF

Let `assignment_id` be the primary key, then:
- `grade`is a fact of `student_id`, thus a non-key field is a fact about another non-key field, violating 4NF.
- `professor_email` is a fact of `professor`, thus a non-key field is a fact about another non-key field, violating 4NF.
- `classroom` is not a fact of `assignment_id`, thus a non-key field does not provide a fact about the entity uniquely identified by the primary key, violating 4NF.

## What Changes I Made and How these Changes Make the Data 4NF-Compliant
- I split the original table into four smaller tables, with four different kinds of entities: assignments, students, professors, and sections.
- For table 1, I set `assignment_id` as the primary key, and set non-key fields: `due_date`, `assignment_topic`, `section_id`, and `relevant_reading`, which are all facts of assignment and they are not facts of each other. Then, this table is compliant with 4NF.
- For table 2, I set `student_id` and `assignment_id` as the compound primary key, and set a non-key field: `grade`, which is a fact of the entity uniquely identified by the compound primary key. Then, this table is clearly compliant with 4NF.
- For table 3, I set `professor_id` as the primary key, and set non-key fields: `professor`, and `professor_email`, which are two facts of professor and they are not facts of each other. And clearly, this is compliant with 4NF.
- For table 4, I set `section_id` as the primary key, and set non-key fields: `classroom`, and `professor_id`, which are two facts of serction and they are not facts of each other. Thus, this is compliant with 4NF as well. 
- Altogether, the original table has been transformed into four samller tables, and become compliant with 4NF.
